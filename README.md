gradient_descent_variants
=========================

Serveral different variants of gradient descent in Spark are implemented here, in order to enhance both the statistical efficiency and hardware efficiency of GLM(Generalized Linear Model) in Spark.

**Affected algorithms in Spark**

* Logistic Regression

* SVM

* Linear Regression

* Lasso

* Ridge Regression
